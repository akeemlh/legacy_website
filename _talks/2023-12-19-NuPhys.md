This poster was presented at the 2023 NuPhys conference held at King's College London. It describes my contributions to data preservation efforts at MINERvA. This is the [same poster (Again!)](/talks/2023-08-10-inss-poster) presented earlier at the INSS at Fermilab and at the [2023 STFC Summer School](/talks/2023-09-07-stfc-summer-school-poster).
