This poster was presented at the STFC HEP Summer School hosted at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in September 2023. It describes my contributions to data preservation efforts at MINERvA. This is the [same poster](/talks/2023-08-10-inss-poster) presented earlier at the INSS at Fermilab.<!-- (NOTE TO SELF: PUT THE POSTER REFERENCES HERE). -->
