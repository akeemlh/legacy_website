This post is in-progress: When I get round to it this will summarize the project I recently completed to construct a hydroponic vertical tower from scratch and enable wifi based monitoring of my garden greenhouse and data logging with the ESP32 microcontroller. This post may be updated with with progress pictures throughout the growing season. For now, in short: I constructed a hydroponic rain tower from inexpensive UPVC materials enabled with envirnoment monitoring, utilising the ESP-32 WROOM Wi-Fi and BT enabled microcontroller, all powered by a small 5-10W solar panel. Currently, the tower contains lettuce and pak choi, but in future I intend to experiment with more nutrient hungry plants like melons & strawberries, which are known to grow incredibly well in hydroponic systems.
