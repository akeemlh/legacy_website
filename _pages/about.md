I am a first year PhD student studying at Queen Mary University of London under the supervision of Dr Abigail Waldron. I am working on investigating the properties of neutrinos as part of the MINERÎ½A and DUNE collaborations. I also have experience and interest in software development. This website serves as both an academic and a avocational website. 

This website is very much a work in progress
